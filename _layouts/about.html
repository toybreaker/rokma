			Working with Rokma is a smooth process that starts with discussing the topic and exploring its aspects, zooming in on the details and out on the big picture, evaluating pro and cons until the direction is clear and shared... then he dives into deep research, planning and execution and you can sleep peacefully.

			Can you hire a mind to benefit your company? Rokma's story demonstrates you definitively can! This guy has lived and worked all over the world and is familiar with a broad selection of cultural views. A natural maker, he has capably taken many projects from conception to completion, building startups before start-up times. An entrepreneur involved in publishing, advertising, visual communication and web design since the beginning he has always stayed current. Some of his works led the way, opening paths and setting new norms in their context.
