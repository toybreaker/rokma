Back in 1989 Rok designs, consults and supervise a public skatepark project. It's Italy's first free public skatepark made out of concrete and payed by the city council. Three parks were consequently built in Milano's outskirts in year 1991 and 1992. A pioneer example of today's mainstream public facilities.
