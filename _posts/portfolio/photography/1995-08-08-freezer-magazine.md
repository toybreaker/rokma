Creating FREEZER magazine I built a creative lab with young motivated enthusiasts and really destroyed boundaries and cliches of contemporary media.

FREEZER was photo centered and took printed press beyond average, both in &lt;what to show&gt;  and &lt;how to show it&gt;.

Introducing concepts like Shared Intellectual Property, Copyright Free, Citizen Journalism, D.I.Y., Independent Free Press Distribution.

FREEZER performed a seminal work in the Italian publishing world, inspired several clones and influenced at large editorial and commercial productions.
