Shot during the Ogoh-ogoh parade,
in Denpasar centre,
Bali,
Indonesia.

These [papier-mâché](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9) crafts,
2 to 4 metre high,
are made each year in the villages of the island.

They mostly represent mythological creatures,
with the odd peculiar fantasy obsessing local youth.

This selection groups few of the top ones.
