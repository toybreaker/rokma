 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toybreaker/rokma.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/toybreaker/rokma)

### [Rokma](http://rokma.com)

Ultra light mobile-first static website. Responsive UI. Jekyll gh-pages portfolio, tested!  Adhering to [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle),   [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (uhm... well, partly. Really not yet!)

v 16.4.0


## 2DOs

Urgent:

- responsive img w/ srcset & [gulp grinder](https://github.com/toybreaker/grinder)

Sometime soon:

- quick contact form

Maybe:

- youtube video embeds

- service workers

## Slider considerations:

- [ ] [swiper.js](http://www.idangero.us/swiper/) (20kb) | fade need img as backgrounds: [demo](http://www.idangero.us/swiper/demos/16-effect-fade.html), [code](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/blob/master/demos/16-effect-fade.html)
- [ ] [flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/) (58kb) | cool but hum...
- [ ] [vegas](https://github.com/jaysalvat/vegas) (64kb) | need at least zepto (9kb) or jquery(84kb)
- [X] native scroll + [scrollReveal.js](https://github.com/jlmakes/scrollReveal.js/tree/master) (9kb)

## Develop:

Use master branch to dev so [Travis-ci](https://github.com/toybreaker/rokma/blob/gh-pages/.travis.yml),  which is currently set to check master only, can test it. When test pass, merge master > gh-pages.
